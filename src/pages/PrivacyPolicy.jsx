        Security and Privacy in Public Cloud Computing
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-500">
        The privacy controls included in this section are based on those identified in the Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. Table 4.5 provides a description of each of the privacy control families. These privacy controls provide the safeguards (i.e., administrative, technical, and physical) to be implemented by the CSP or within the public cloud service when it has been determined that PII is being collected and stored.

        Informed Consent and the Perception of Privacy Control
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-500">
        One of the pillars of modern data protection and privacy management is the notion of control. Privacy as control of personal information is a foundational principle as powerful as the “right to be left alone” of Warren and Brandais. Even more important for our chapter, the idea of providing citizens with the right to control the usage and dissemination of personal data is at the core of most online privacy initiatives, regulations, and proposals. Citizens of the digital world, customers of Internet merchants, and users of online services should be able to decide which PII to release, to whom, for which purposes, and for how long based on the privacy control theory. It was Alan Westin in 1967 to define privacy as “the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others” [39]. However, like the many developments in the decades following the days of the small Kodak cameras used to peek into people's private life demonstrated, the “right to be left alone” and the theory of privacy control are much more difficult to achieve and complex to analyze than initially believed. The same Alan Westin recognized the intrinsic complex nature of privacy by writing in 2003 an historical overview of how the concept of privacy changed, reflecting social and political events and issues in the last four decades
